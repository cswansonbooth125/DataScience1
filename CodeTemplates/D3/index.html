                <h2>Most unique neighborhood businesses in Seattle, WA</h2>
                <p>As told by The Pudding’s resident Seattleite, <a href=https://twitter.com/ProQuesAsker>Amber
                        Thomas</a>.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="zoom_here">
                <p>I used to imagine that one day I’d choose my next travel destination by closing my eyes and blindly
                    pointing to a spot on a map. Our decision to move to Seattle wasn’t quite so haphazard, but not by
                    much.
                    Neither my boyfriend nor I had been to the city. Neither of us had jobs, apartments, or family
                    there. We
                    were just looking for a change from our Orlando lives and thought that Seattle sounded like a place
                    that
                    was just our speed.</p>
                <p>Luckily, we fell in love with the city almost instantly. Somewhere between the trees, the coast, the
                    mountains, and the people, we found ourselves right at home. We settled in Belltown, a little
                    neighborhood right near the tourist-y part of the city, and although it may not be everyone’s cup of
                    <del>tea</del> coffee, we love it. We said goodbye to our cars and hello to walking shoes and bus
                    passes. Contrary to public opinion, our days are more green and lovely than gray and dreary. And in
                    true
                    Seattle fashion, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/sherlockthedox/>our dog</a> comes with
                    us on every adventure.

                <div>
                    <p>”Oh, you <em>have</em> to see the Fremont troll!” I had no idea what the “Fremont troll” was, but
                        <em>everyone</em> told me that I just <em>had</em> to see it when I got to Seattle. As it turns
                        out,
                        it’s an enormous <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_Troll>statue of a
                            troll</a> beneath the Aurora bridge, crushing a Volkswagen beetle. The statue itself is
                        endearing and quirky and it turns out that Fremont, the neighborhood that it calls home, is no
                        different. The area’s unofficial motto is <em>“De Libertas Quirkas”</em> or “Freedom to be
                        Peculiar”
                        and I couldn’t think of a phrase more fitting. The scene is artistic and entertaining and our
                        analyses suggest that the neighborhood is home to an unusually high number of massage, skin
                        care,
                        and acupuncture businesses. For what it’s worth, every Seattleite I’ve mentioned this to laughs
                        and
                        says “That sounds about right”. You do you, Fremont.

                    <li>Bars</li>

                </ol>
                <p>The first time I ventured to “Cap Hill”, I decided to walk there. But in Seattle, when a neighborhood
                    has
                    “hill” in the name, they generally aren’t kidding. My muscles burned as I made my way up the
                    unbelievably steep incline but the views at the top were worth the effort. The streets were busy in
                    a
                    way that most of Seattle is not, but looking a bit closer, some people were actually dancing, albeit
                    slightly awkwardly, in the middle of the walkway. There were <a
                        href=https://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/The-story-behind-the-steps-in-the-sidewalk-1200133.php?source=mypi>bronze
                        shoe prints and arrows</a> adorning the sidewalk on Broadway, teaching
                    passersby how to rumba, foxtrot, tango, or “obeebo”, a made-up dance that happens when you walk
                    directly
                    towards someone on the street and both awkwardly try to move out of one another’s way. The sidewalk
                    dancing is entertaining both during the day, with people genuinely trying to learn the steps, and in
                    the
                    evenings, when people have left the nearby bars and nightclubs and take their alcohol-enhanced
                    dancing
                    skills to the streets. Rainbows are also visible throughout the area, as Capitol Hill is home to
                    Seattle’s largest LGBTQ community. “Love is Love” signs hang in nearly every shop window and you
                    literally walk across rainbows when passing through intersections.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Moving to Seattle marked a career-transition for me. I was leaving behind the world of marine
                            biology and I was anxious about the change. So, before our apartment was even furnished, I
                            trekked to the city’s Roosevelt neighborhood for a <a
                                href=https://www.meetup.com/Data-Viz-Jam-Sessions/events/248150943/>data
                                visualization meetup</a>. It was held in a <a href=http://www.waywardcoffee.com/>coffee
                                shop</a> whose slogan was “an independent coffee haven for geeks”, so,
                            naturally, I felt right at home. As I sat at the table, sipping a drink named after some
                            Sci-Fi
                            character or another, I had no idea what neighborhood I was in. So, even though our data
                            suggests that most people may visit Roosevelt for some type of medical care, I will always
                            think
                            of that area as a place for new beginnings.</p>
