      In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels.    </p>

  <p>
      Lil Wayne's ascent is the story of <b>Cash Money</b>. The Dirty South starts with <b>LaFace Records</b>.  The east-coast/west-coast feud is <b>Bad Boys vs. Death Row</b>. In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isn't just a business deal, but a commitment to an identity.

      We wanted to surface the notable labels in hip hop's history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard (collaborating with <a href="twitter.com/kevinbeacham">Kevin Beacham</a> of <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymesayers_Entertainment">Rhymesayers</a> to call out insights). By highlighting the labels who produced the msot hits at any given time, we'd understand who was wielding  enormous influence on hip hop's sound, distribution, and direction.
